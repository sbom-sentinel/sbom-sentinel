# SBOM Sentinel

> **Know what to fix first.**\
> Explainable prioritization for software dependency vulnerabilities.

SBOM Sentinel is a proposed security and machine-learning system for
helping engineering and security teams decide **which software
dependency vulnerabilities should be investigated first**.

Modern applications can contain a large number of third-party
dependencies and vulnerability findings. A vulnerability list alone does
not answer the operational question: **What should the team spend its
next hour investigating?**

SBOM Sentinel addresses this problem by combining Software Bill of
Materials (SBOM) information with vulnerability intelligence, dependency
context, reachability, package health, and other repository signals, and
then using a trained ranking model to produce an explainable
investigation priority.

> **Project status:** Proposed / research-oriented MVP. The
> implementation focus is SBOM upload/import → enrichment → ranking →
> dashboard. Automated repository scanning and continuous integrations
> are considered extensions.

## Problem

A vulnerability scanner can produce a list of vulnerable dependencies,
but a vulnerability list still leaves an important decision:

> **Which finding matters here, and what should we investigate next?**

Severity alone is not always enough to determine the practical priority
of a vulnerability in a particular application.

For example, two vulnerabilities may have the same CVSS score while
differing significantly in:

-   Known exploitation
-   Application reachability
-   Dependency depth
-   Dependency relationships
-   Package maintenance activity
-   Release activity
-   Available security evidence

SBOM Sentinel therefore focuses on **vulnerability prioritization**,
rather than simply producing another vulnerability list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Objective

The primary objective of SBOM Sentinel is to create an **ordered,
explainable investigation queue** for software dependency risks.

The system aims to:

1.  Understand the software components and dependencies in an
    application through an SBOM.
2.  Enrich dependency and vulnerability information with security
    intelligence.
3.  Analyze dependency and reachability context.
4.  Combine multiple signals using a machine-learning ranking model.
5.  Produce a priority ranking for investigation.
6.  Show the evidence and factors behind the ranking.
7.  Support human review when important context is uncertain or missing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Scope

The proposed project-domain composition is:

  Area                            Estimated Scope
  ----------------------------- -----------------
  ML / Data Science                           35%
  Cybersecurity                               30%
  Backend / Data Engineering                  15%
  Graph / Dependency Analysis                 10%
  Frontend / Product                           5%
  DevOps / MLOps                               5%

These are project-domain estimates, not percentages of AI-tool usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## System Workflow

The proposed end-to-end workflow is:

``` text
                Software Repository / Existing SBOM
                              |
                              v
                     Generate / Import SBOM

                              v
                    Security Dashboard
                              |
                              v
              Downstream Integrations / Actions
              GitHub • Jira • Discord • CI/CD
```

### MVP boundary

The MVP focuses on:

``` text
SBOM Upload / Import
        ↓
Vulnerability & Security Enrichment
        ↓
Dependency / Reachability Analysis
        ↓
ML Prioritization
        ↓
Explainable Investigation Queue
        ↓
Dashboard
```

Automated repository scanning and continuous integrations can be treated
as later extensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SBOM

A Software Bill of Materials provides structured information about the
software components used by an application.

SBOM Sentinel uses the SBOM as the starting point for understanding:

-   Software components
-   Component versions
-   Dependency relationships
-   Dependency context
-   Potentially vulnerable dependencies

The proposed workflow supports generating or importing an SBOM.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Intelligence

SBOM Sentinel combines several categories of evidence rather than
relying on one security score.

### Security evidence

-   Vulnerability severity
-   Known exploitation
-   Published exploitability signals

### Package health

-   Package maintenance
-   Package activity
-   Release activity / release frequency

### Application context

-   Dependency relationships
-   Dependency depth
-   Reachability when verified
-   Explicit unknown / missing data

The system is designed to preserve an **unknown** state when information
such as reachability cannot be verified instead of treating missing
information as a definitive negative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Machine Learning

The ML component learns a **multi-signal priority ranking** rather than
relying on severity alone.

Conceptually:

``` text
Security Signals
       +
Dependency Context
       +
Reachability
       +
Package Health
       +
Repository Signals
       |
       v
 ML Ranking Model
       |
       v
Priority Ranking
```

Example feature groups include:

``` text
CVSS
Known exploitation
Reachability
Dependency context
Package health
Release activity
```

The model's output is an **investigation priority ranking**, for
example:

``` text
#1  Fix Now
#2  Investigate
#3  Monitor
```

The project is therefore a ranking/prioritization system rather than
simply a binary vulnerability detector.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example

Consider two vulnerabilities:

### Vulnerability A

``` text
CVSS             = 9.8
Known exploited  = Yes
Dependency depth = 2
Reachable        = Yes
Package activity = Low
Release frequency= Low
```

### Vulnerability B

``` text
CVSS             = 9.8
Known exploited  = No
Dependency depth = 8
Reachable        = No
Package activity = High
Release frequency= High
```

A severity-only approach may treat both findings similarly because both
have a CVSS score of 9.8.

SBOM Sentinel considers the additional signals and uses them to
determine a more context-aware investigation order.

The goal is to answer:

> **Which vulnerability should the security team investigate first?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Explainability

A high-priority result should not be a black box.

SBOM Sentinel is designed to show the factors that contributed to a
finding's priority.

The investigation interface is intended to provide:

-   Priority
-   Security evidence
-   Exploitation evidence
-   Dependency context
-   Reachability information
-   Package context
-   Recommended next action

The project also proposes explainability for the trained ranking model
so users can understand **which factors changed the priority**.

Human review remains important when context is uncertain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## MVP

The proposed MVP interface centers on an **Investigation Queue**.

Conceptually, the queue contains:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Priority          Package           Evidence          Action
  ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- -----------------
  1                 High-risk         Known             Investigate now
                    dependency        exploitation +    
                                      reachable path    

  2                 High-severity     Reachability      Verify exposure
                    dependency        unknown           

  3                 Lower-priority    Limited context   Review
                    dependency                          
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The interface is intended to make the next security action clear rather
than simply presenting a large list of CVEs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Product Vision

The product vision is:

> **A clear next action for every dependency risk decision.**

The system aims to provide:

-   An ordered queue
-   Visible evidence
-   Human review where context is uncertain

The central product idea is:

``` text
Many vulnerability findings
          ↓
Context + evidence
          ↓
Prioritized investigation queue
          ↓
Clear next action
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Question

The central research question is:

> **Can multi-signal ML prioritization improve investigation ordering
> over severity-only or rule-based baselines?**

The project therefore evaluates the usefulness of combining multiple
signals rather than assuming that a single security metric is
sufficient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Foundation

The SBOM Sentinel concept is founded on the paper:

**Supply Chain Risk Analysis via SBOM Data Enrichment**

**Authors:** Antoine Lemay & Neeraj Katiyar\
**Conference:** 2025 IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)

The reference work enriches SBOM information with repository maintenance
metadata to analyze software supply-chain risk and identify libraries
with risk factors associated with XZ-style infiltration.

### How SBOM Sentinel extends the foundation

SBOM Sentinel proposes a practical prioritization layer that combines:

-   Vulnerability information
-   Exploitability
-   Dependency information
-   Reachability
-   Package-health signals

and then:

``` text
Combine signals
      ↓
Learn a ranking
      ↓
Explain the ranking
      ↓
Produce investigation order
```

## Future Extensions

The project presentation identifies the following as possible downstream
or extended capabilities:

-   Automated repository scanning
-   Continuous security scanning
-   GitHub integrations
-   Jira integrations
-   Discord integrations
-   CI/CD integrations
-   Additional automated security actions

These capabilities are extensions of the MVP rather than its core
implementation focus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Disclaimer

SBOM Sentinel is a research and final-year project concept focused on
vulnerability prioritization.

The priority produced by the system should support security
investigation and human decision-making. It should not be treated as an
automatic replacement for security engineering judgment, especially when
dependency reachability or other application context is uncertain.
